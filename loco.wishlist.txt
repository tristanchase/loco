Add --help section/option
   Find out if you can less text from within a file
   If not, create a help file and source that

Find out if pagers exist that do not take !(exec shell)
   If they do, find out which ones and have loco work around them by activating the "Command: " and "Line No.: " section of the script (define as a function?)

Set pager to $PAGER?

[DONE]Figure out !row n command workaround.  Would rather have normal syntax !command n

Set up .conf file?

Clean up tabs/indentations in actual file

Push loco as a project

Add --conf option?

Configure on first run?
   Test for .loco.conf file?

.conf parameters:
   count.entries threshhold
   pager

[DONE]Add find function if count.entries = 0 due to updatedb lag.  Something like find foo somewhere in your $HOME directory and send output to $PAGER in loco style.

find $HOME -name *foo* -print0 | xargs -0 filetype | sed = | sed 'N;s/\n/\t/' > ${outfile}

Display the file a target points to:

...
33	/path/to/link	[@] ->	/path/to/target
...

Switch output of filetype so that the file type symbol comes before the /path/to/file && edit row.sh accordingly (change field numbewr fromw 2 to 3?).

Find out if rifle will open $outfile.
