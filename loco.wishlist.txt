TODO
* Working on getopt (2020-04-05)
  * File here /usr/share/doc/util-linux/examples/getopt-parse.bash
  * Web
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/192249/how-do-i-parse-command-line-arguments-in-bash/14203146#14203146

* Add --help section/option
   Find out if you can less text from within a file
   If not, create a help file and source that

* Find out if pagers exist that do not take !(exec shell)
   If they do, find out which ones and have loco work around them by activating the "Command: " and "Line No.: " section of the script (define as a function?)

* Set pager to $PAGER?

* Set up .conf file?

* Clean up tabs/indentations in actual file

* Push loco as a project

* Add --conf option?

* Configure on first run?
   Test for .loco.conf file?

* .conf parameters:
   count.entries threshhold
   pager

* Switch output of filetype so that the file type symbol comes before the /path/to/file && edit row.sh accordingly (change field number from 2 to 3?).

DONE
+ 2017-11-16 Find out if rifle will open $outfile. (It will not. However, it *will* open a file from the shell escape [e.g. !rifle `row 52` will open the file on line 52 with the appropriate program if it can find one].)

+ 2017-11-16 Display the target file a link points to:

...
33	/path/to/link	[@] ->	/path/to/target
...

+ Add find function if count.entries = 0 due to updatedb lag.  Something like find foo somewhere in your $HOME directory and send output to $PAGER in loco style.

find $HOME -name *foo* -print0 | xargs -0 filetype | sed = | sed 'N;s/\n/\t/' > ${outfile}

+ Figure out !row n command workaround.  Would rather have normal syntax !command n
